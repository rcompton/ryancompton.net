I am currently a software engineer at [Google](https://www.google.com/) working on news feed ranking for Google Discover. Prior to Google I led applied machine learning at [Clarifai](http://www.clarifai.com/) in New York, NY. I was previously on the research staff at Howard Hughes Laboratories in Malibu, CA. In 2012 I finished a mathematics PhD at UCLA. My graduate work involved [sparsity promoting optimization in quantum mechanical signal processing](http://code.google.com/p/typingstuff/downloads/list) and before that I was a math major at [New College](https://www.ncf.edu/).
