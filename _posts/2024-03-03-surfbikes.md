On a few occasions I've been fortunate enough to live withing biking distance of a surf break. One of my favorite activities to do in this situation is outfit a bicycle with a surfboard rack and use it for transportation to the beach.

Here are the bikes I've used for this. PVC construction inspired by <http://www.rodndtube.com/surf/info/surf_racks/BicycleSurfboardRack.shtml>.

## GT Karakoram -- 2007

I got this bicycle for free when I purchased my first mountain bike from someone on Craigslist in Glendale in late 2006. I took both bicycles back to Westwood via bus where I was promptly stopped and questioned by the police as to why I had two bikes with me on the bus. Neither showed up as reported missing so they let me out. The next year I moved to Santa Monica near Wilshire and 17th Street and put this together so I could ride to Venice Beach to surf in the morning. The ride was long
and the waves were usually bad but I enjoyed every minute of it. In 2008 I moved too far from the coast for this to be practical so I donated the bicycle to [Bikerowave](https://bikerowave.org/) and didn't put another one together for ~10 years.

## Shogun (unknown model) -- 2017

When I started working at Google we moved to Santa Cruz and I rode the corp bus into Mountain View every morning. But if I got up early enough I could sneak in a quick session, usually at Steamer Lane, before work via bicycle. This bike, an unknown model built by Shogun, was discarded by one of my neighbors. I fixed it up and slapped an off-the-shelf surfboard rack on it so I could get right up to the cliff and lock it on the fence overlooking the ocean. It lasted almost a year until someone stole it from the carport while I was in the backyard putting my board in the shed.

## Trek 800 -- 2018

After the Shogun was stolen I picked up this from someone on Craigslist and rode it home in the rain. I opted to build another PVC rack this time as I was unimpressed with the one I bought for the Shogun. When we moved away from Santa Cruz I gave it away.
