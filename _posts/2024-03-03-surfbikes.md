On a few occasions I've been fortunate enough to live withing biking distance of a surf break. One of my favorite activities to do in this situation is outfit a bicycle with a surfboard rack and use it for transportation to the beach.

Here are the bikes I've used for this. PVC construction inspired by <http://www.rodndtube.com/surf/info/surf_racks/BicycleSurfboardRack.shtml>.

## GT Karakoram -- 2007

I got this bicycle for free when I purchased my first mountain bike from someone on Craigslist in Glendale in late 2006. I took both bicycles back to Westwood via bus where I was promptly stopped and questioned by the police as to why I had two bikes with me on the bus. Neither showed up as reported missing so they let me out. The next year I moved to Santa Monica near Wilshire and 17th Street and put this together so I could ride to Venice Beach to surf in the morning. The ride was long
and the waves were usually bad but I enjoyed every minute of it. In 2008 I moved too far from the coast for this to be practical so I donated the bicycle to [Bikerowave](https://bikerowave.org/) and didn't put another one together for ~10 years.
