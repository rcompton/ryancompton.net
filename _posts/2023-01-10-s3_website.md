First post in 5+ years! I used to use [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) to publish this blog. Turns out that it's been so long since writing anything that it's been deprecated with nothing to replace it.

[Following this](https://pagertree.com/blog/jekyll-site-to-aws-s3-using-github-actions) I've managed to setup Github Actions to build/deploy the blog. A few small changes:

+ `master` is supposed to be `main` 
+ the [email protected] stuff in their blog post wasn't working for me

Here's the deploy script I'm using to publish this post:

{% highlight yaml %}
name: Jekyll build and S3 deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
  AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: 'us-west-2'

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@359bebbc29cbe6c87da6bc9ea3bc930432750108
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.1'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bundle install
      - name: "Build Site"
        run: bundle exec jekyll build
        env:
          JEKYLL_ENV: production
      - name: "Deploy to AWS S3"
        run: aws s3 sync ./_site/ s3://${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME }} --acl public-read --delete --cache-control max-age=604800
      - name: "Create AWS Cloudfront Invalidation"
        run: aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${{ secrets.AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID }} --paths "/*"
{% endhighlight %}
