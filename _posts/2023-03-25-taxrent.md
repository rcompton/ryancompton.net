[California's Prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13) -- the famous property tax limitation of 1978 -- is often advertised to renters as a way to keep rents low. The pitch has always been that landlords are nice and, when given tax cuts, will pass their savings on to their tenants. This promise was even made explicitly during the initial campaign in the 70s:

This was pretty obviously a lie. Howard Jarvis is the guy signing the agreement! And of course shortly after Prop 13 passed rents didn't go down and [tenants lashed out with aggressive rent control laws in response](
https://luskincenter.history.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2018/09/People-Are-Simply-Unable-to-Pay-the-Rent.pdf). But despite all that people today still believe that Prop 13 is keeping rents lower than they would be without it.

**Here is some data which suggests otherwise.**

Craigslist is a great source of rental ads. In addition to price Craiglist ads often contain rich information such as number of bedrooms, house type, and even exact addresses. To handle typos and formatting issues advertised addressed can be disambiguated using a [geocoding service](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview). Once one has unambiguous addresses highly detailed property tax information can be downloaded from the [LA County Assessor Portal](https://portal.assessor.lacounty.gov/parceldetail/7250005018).

Joining all this together gets a dataset that has the advertised rent, square footage, and property tax assessment for each address. The LA County Assessor Portal also provides the ["base year"](https://assessor.lacounty.gov/homeowners/realproperty) which is the year the property last changed ownership.

Specifically, I downloaded 6,242,395 rental ads and filtered to cases where the information in the Craigslist ad exactly matches the information in the LA County Assessor Portal (ie. number of bedrooms, sqft, home type etc.). We restrict attention to only single family homes because public tax assessments for apartment buildings do not resolve to individual units and rental ads almost never specify unit numbers. These restrictions are necessary to remove noise from the crawled data but they do decrease it's size quite a bit leaving rental data for 459 houses.

So now I can make the following chart:

Howard Jarvis would have you believe that as `assesment_per_sqft` decreases then `rent_per_sqft` would also decrease. But it doesn't. In fact what we see is a large hairball where rent and tax aren't correlated at all. There are plenty of long-held homes (indicated by red dots) enjoying low tax assessments while charging the same rent as newly-purchased homes (blue dots). Differences in tax assessments do not translate into differences in rent.

To put it another way: Prop 13 is not [incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incidence) on renters -- a statement in line with [mountains of data](https://gameofrent.com/content/can-lvt-be-passed-on-to-tenants) from other locations.

Let's look at a quick example for emphasis.

Here is a long-held 837 sqft house in Silverlake. Rent is $3500 per month. The owner pays $484 per year in property taxes on a $29,511 assessment. From the tax assessor's point of view, if you rent this house in January you will have paid off more than it's complete value before Halloween.

Now, just 3.5 miles away, is a more recently purchased house of the same size with the same number of bedrooms. It's currently up for rent at $2,995 and the tax assessment is [$579,693](https://portal.assessor.lacounty.gov/parceldetail/5446011019) (more than 10x the previous home). The rent, however, is about the same at roughly $4/sqft.

And take a look at what's going on over time (hint: rent goes up):

![rentvtime]({{ site.url}}/assets/pix/rentvtime.png)

A vicious cycle is at work here. As rent and home prices soar, landlords enjoy a decline in their effective tax rates and a widening of their profit margins.  Meanwhile, tenants are burdened with the necessity of spending more to maintain their residences, while also facing the need to save up for the ever-more-distant day when they might buy a home of their own. And if they do, they will be confronted with an onerous tax burden, often as much as ten times greater than that which the previous owner paid (cf. [https://www.taxfairnessproject.org](https://www.taxfairnessproject.org) for a map).

There is simply no reason to continue on this way. Rent is set by what the market will bear, not what profits landlords thinks they deserve. It does matter whether a landlord is new to the scene or an entrenched member of the establishment. Both will charge as much as they can, regardless of their tax rate.

The notion that landlords would somehow be compelled to pass on their tax savings to their tenants is utter nonsense. The only thing preventing landlords from charging exorbitant rents is the simple fact that tenants do not have unlimited financial resources.
