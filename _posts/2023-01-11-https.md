I finally got around to enabling https here. Some notes:

- Namecheap sells ssl certs via PositiveSSL/Comodo. I thought this would be easiest but they don't really work with AWS.

    - I'll never get that $7 back
    - It's more work to import a 3rd party certificate vs. creating one on AWS
    - After importing the 3rd party certificate (which has to happen in N. Virgina) AWS still claims that it's not from a trusted source
    - [Other CNAME gotchas](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51198472/cname-entry-not-working-on-namecheap-using-amazon-certificate-manager)

- Amazon Certificate Manager allows one to create the certificate from AWS for free

    - They'll auto generate the Route 53 CNAME rules for you
    - Still the same weird thing about how you need to do this in N. Virginia even if the rest of you site is elsewhere

- You need to add an "alias" rule to point your custom domain at Cloudfront.

I found [this blog](https://davelms.medium.com/using-a-custom-domain-in-cloudfront-with-an-ssl-certificate-and-route-53-253a72f51056) helpful
