I recently published a paper on the arxiv: <http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2392>, earlier this month it was accepted into the [ChASM](http://www.chasm.ws/) workshop at WebSci. Hereâ€™s the abstract:

Determining the geographic focus of digital media is an essential first step for modern geographic information retrieval. However, publicly-visible location annotations are remarkably sparse in online data. In this work, we demonstrate a method which infers the geographic focus of an online document by examining the locations of Twitter users who share links to the document.
We apply our geotagging technique to multiple datasets built from different content: manually-annotated news articles, GDELT, YouTube, Flickr, Twitter, and Tumblr.
