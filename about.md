I am currently a software engineer at [Google](https://www.google.com/) working on recommendation algorithms that power feed ranking for Google Discover. Prior to Google I led applied machine learning at [Clarifai](http://www.clarifai.com/) in New York, NY. I was previously on the research staff at Howard Hughes Laboratories in Malibu, CA. In 2012 I finished a mathematics PhD at UCLA. My graduate work involved [sparsity promoting optimization in quantum mechanical signal processing](http://code.google.com/p/typingstuff/downloads/list) and before that I was a math major at [New College](https://www.ncf.edu/) (yes, [that New College](https://apnews.com/article/desantis-new-college-florida-woke-timeline-5a5bcd78230ddd2a1adb8021fea8a755)).
